# Student.java Explanation

## 🎯 Objective
To understand how multiple objects can be created from the same class and how methods are used by each object.

---

## 🧠 Step-by-Step Explanation
1. The `Student` class has two variables: `id` and `name`.
2. A method `display()` prints the student's information.
3. In `StudentDemo`, we create two objects: `s1` and `s2`.
4. Each object stores **different values**.
5. When we call `display()` for each object, the output shows their unique data.
