Every line of code that runs in Java must be inside a class. The class name should always start with an uppercase first letter. In our example, we named the class Main.

Note: Java is case-sensitive. MyClass and myclass would be treated as two completely different names.

The name of the Java file must match the class name. So if your class is called Main, the file must be saved as Main.java. This is because Java uses the class name to find and run your code. If the names don't match, Java will give an error and the program will not run.


The main() method is required in every Java program. It is where the program starts running:

// public static void main(String[] args) //


Any code placed inside the main() method will be executed.

For now, you don't need to understand the keywords public, static, and void. You will learn about them later in this tutorial. Just remember: main() is the starting point of every Java program.
